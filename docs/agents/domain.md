# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This repository uses a single-context layout:

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repository root contains the shared domain model and glossary.
- `docs/adr/` contains architecture decision records for the whole repository.
- Do not introduce `CONTEXT-MAP.md` or per-package context files unless the repository is deliberately migrated to a multi-context layout.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`**: read the shared domain model and glossary.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If either location doesn't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag its absence or suggest creating it upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates these files lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, either reconsider language the project doesn't use or note a real gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
